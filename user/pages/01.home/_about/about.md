## About Me

My name is Chris Connor - I am a Glasgow based technology professional with over a decade of experience in the print/digital media/web design and development sector.

In 2011 I relocated to the United Arab Emirates, taking up a position as technology manager for a well-known printing company in the region. During my time in the role I was instrumental in driving change in the way the organisation used technology to reach business goals. From local network infrastructure upgrades to overhaulling the company web sites - I acheived a great deal during my time there.

Iâ€™ve always had a passion for programming and software development, having tinkered with hobbyist projects for over 15 years. In my technology management role I was given the opportunity to actively apply my knowledge on a number of small projects within the business, ranging from workflow and automation programming through to developing internal web applications.

Having witnessed first-hand a noticeable shift towards online ordering and the role software solutions have to play in transforming businesses across industries, I returned to Scotland in 2015 to pursue a degree in software development, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a career in the field.

Having graduated from City of Glasgow College in 2016 with a Higher National Diploma in the top percentile of the cohort, I am now entering my final year at Glasgow Caledonian University Scotland and am currently on track to graduate June 2019 with a projected first-class honours degree in Computing (Software Engineering).
