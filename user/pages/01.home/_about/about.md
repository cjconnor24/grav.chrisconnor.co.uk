## About Me

I am a technology professional with over a decade of experience in the print/digital media/technology sector. Being employed in the printing field since leaving school has enabled me to build skills and gain hands-on experience across all parts of the industry, from machine operation through to digital design and development. This ultimately culminated in a technology position working on web-to-print software systems. 

In 2011 I took the decision to relocate to the United Arab Emirates, taking the position as technology manager for a well-known printing company in the region. During my time in the role I was instrumental in driving change in the way the organisation used technology to reach business goals. From personally overhauling web presence for the company’s numerous brands to migrating the entire security and email infrastructure to cloud-based systems, I led a number of major projects focused on innovation through technology. 

I’ve always had a passion for programming and software development, having tinkered with hobbyist projects for over 15 years. In my technology management role I was given the opportunity to actively apply my knowledge on a number of small projects within the business, ranging from workflow and automation programming through to developing internal web applications.

In recent years, I have witnessed first-hand a noticeable shift towards online ordering and the role software solutions have to play in transforming businesses across industries. It was this that led to a bold decision to return to Scotland to pursue a degree in software development, with the ultimate goal of pursuing a career in the field. 

Having graduated from City of Glasgow College in 2016 with a Higher National Diploma in the top percentile of the cohort, I am now entering my final year at Glasgow Caledonian University Scotland and am currently on track to graduate June 2019 with a projected first-class honours degree in Computing (Software Engineering).
